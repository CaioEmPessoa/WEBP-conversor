<h2> For GUI </h2>

This one is if you're gonna do more complex stuff, like convert a heavy image, convert images and a gif at the same time, or do some of the other features: <br>

Convert png/gif to .webp; <br>
Convert .png to .ico; <br>
And delete all webp images. <br>

<br>
<br>

<h2> For Terminal </h2>

Terminal is a more simpler/faster one, you just put the .exe on the folder there is webp/png images and choose between: <br>
1 = convert .webp to .png <br>
2 = convert .webp to .gif <br>
3 = convert .png to .ico <br>
