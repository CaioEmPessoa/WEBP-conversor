<h2> For GUI </h2>

This one is if you're gonna do more complex stuff, like convert a heavy image, convert images and a gif at the same time, or do some of the other features:

Convert png/gif to .webp;
Convert .png to .ico;
And delete all webp images.

<h2> For Terminal </h2>

Terminal is a more simpler/faster one, you just put the .exe on the folder there is webp/png images and choose between:
1 = convert .webp to .png
2 = convert .webp to .gif
3 = convert .png to .ico
